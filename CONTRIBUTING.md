# Contributing to Pylon

Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to Pylon! We welcome contributions from anyone and are grateful for even the smallest of improvements.

## How to Contribute

#### **Using GitHub Flow**

We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** and commit them to your branch.
3. **Create a pull request** against the `main` branch with a clear description of the change.
4. **Review and address comments** if any reviewer requests changes or ask any clarification questions.

#### **Found a Bug?**

- Before you file a bug report, **please check if the issue has already been reported** by searching the Issues in our GitHub repository.
- If the issue is not yet reported, **open a new issue**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case**.

#### **Have a Feature Proposal or Enhancement?**

- For feature proposals, first, **check if there's an existing proposal** in the Issues.
- If there isn't one, feel free to pitch your idea on the issues list before starting to work. This gives you a chance to gather feedback and support.
- Wait for feedback from the maintainers for the green light before investing a lot of time.
- Keep in mind that not all feature proposals will be accepted.

#### **Want to Submit Code Changes?**

- Great! Start with an issue or feature request, then **fork the repo**, and **follow the GitHub Flow**.
- Stay consistent with the code style and practices already established in the project.
- **Write tests** for your changes and ensure that all tests pass.
- Submit a **pull request**, with a clear list of what you've done and a link to the GitHub issue for context.
- **Celebrate your contribution** after your pull request is merged!

#### **Looking to Contribute to Documentation?**

- Documentation improvements are always welcome. **Follow the same process** for submitting a code change.
- If you're adding new content or changing existing content, **ensure it's clear, concise, and serves the project's objectives**.
- Submit a pull request with your changes.

## Pull Request Review Process

Once you submit a pull request, one of the project maintainers will review the changes. They may request additional changes or clarification on certain aspects of your code. PRs are merged after approval by the maintainers.
